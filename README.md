# Minimum-Partition-Problem
This project tackles the minimum partition problem, which aims to divide a set of integers into two subsets with the smallest possible difference in their sums. We compare two approaches: brute force, which checks all partitions, and dynamic programming, which builds solutions efficiently. We evaluate both using time and space complexity.
